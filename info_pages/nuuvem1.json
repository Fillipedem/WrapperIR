In order to save herself, and indeed, all of humanity, she must battle her way through a demon-infested castle summoned by Gebel, her old friend whose body and mind has become more crystal than flesh.\nHighlights\n\nA game soundtrack by genre and industry veteran Michiru Yamane, performed by a full live orchestra ensemble.\nAddictingly tight and satisfying gameplay alongside a rich new story in the gothic dark fantasy style of Koji Igarashi, the celebrated godfather of "Igavania" games.\nStory cut scenes and NPC interactions fully voice acted by a star-studded cast, including actors like David Hayter, Ray Chase and Erica Lindbeck to name just a few. (Seriously, we have a lot of voice acting star power in this game, it\'s kinda nuts...)\nThree playable characters, two of which have yet to be revealed...\nLiterally a metric ton of weapons and spells, which you can upgrade, level up and visually customize.\nBeautiful 2.5D graphics: 3D models crafted with a lot of love and care on a 2D game environment. That means lots of cool tricks that "regular" 2D can\'t do...\n\n\n'}
